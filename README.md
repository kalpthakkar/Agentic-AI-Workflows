## 🌟 Overview

**Agentic-AI-Workflows** is a **centralized library** of reusable, modular, plug-and-play AI workflows built around:

- ➰ **Reasoning loops (ReAct, Reflexion, Tree-of-Thought, etc.)**  
- 🛠️ **Tool-using agents & API-calling agents**  
- 🧠 **Planning, orchestration, and delegation systems**  
- 🚀 **Automation workflows for real tasks**  
- 🗃️ **Domain-specific agent configurations (RAG, research agents, code agents, etc.)**  
- ♻️ **Reusable workflow components for building custom agent architectures**

This repository serves as a **knowledge base + template library + implementation hub** for rapidly building and deploying intelligent, autonomous systems.


---


> 📌 **Every workflow is self-contained.**  
> Each subdirectory can include:
> - `README.md` for the workflow  
> - `main.py` or `run.py`  
> - `agent.json` / `config.yaml`  
> - `tools/`, `memory/`, or `components/`

## 🚀 Key Highlights

### 🧩 **1. Modular & Composable**
Build complex AI systems using small reusable components:
- Agents  
- Tools  
- Memory modules  
- Controllers  
- Workflow steps  
- Planners  

Combine them like **LEGO blocks**.

---

### 🧬 **2. Support for Multiple Agentic Patterns**
This library includes workflows built using:
- **ReAct** (Reason + Act)  
- **Reflexion** (self-critique loops)  
- **Tree of Thought (ToT)**  
- **Graph-based agent routing**  
- **Planner–executor architectures**  
- **Multi-agent collaboration**  
- **Long-running task automation**  

---

### ✅ **3. Real-World Ready**
Workflows can include:
- Web search  
- Browser automations  
- API calls  
- Document parsing  
- Code generation & execution  
- Data transformations  
- Task automation  
- Research pipelines  

---

### 📦 **4. Pre-configured Templates**
Each workflow folder can act as a standalone template you can clone and customize:
- Research assistant  
- Coding assistant  
- Data analysis agent  
- Workflow automation bot  
- Task planner  
- RAG or Graph RAG reasoning agent  
- Multi-tool executor  

---

### 🧪 **5. Transparent, Traceable, Debuggable**
Workflows are built with traceability in mind:
- Step-by-step logs  
- Chain-of-thought visualization (when allowed)  
- Tool response logging  
- Failure recovery hooks  
- Simulation mode / dry run mode  

---

## 🧠 Philosophy

This repository promotes:

**✔ Agentic Modularity**
<br>
Each flow stands alone but shares common principles.

**✔ Reusability**
<br>
Copy → modify → deploy any workflow.

**✔ Extensibility**
<br>
Every directory can be extended with:
<br>
• more tools  
• deeper pipelines  
• multi-agent collaboration  
• memory & knowledge retrieval  

**✔ Transparency**
<br>
Human-readable configs & simple code structures.
